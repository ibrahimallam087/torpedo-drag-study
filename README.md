# Torpedo Drag Investigation

This repository contains resources, data, and scripts for the investigation of drag forces acting on an underwater torpedo. The aim is to analyze the hydrodynamic performance of torpedo designs and study the factors influencing drag under various conditions.

## Project Goals

1. **Understand Drag Dynamics**: Analyze the hydrodynamic drag acting on a torpedo model in underwater conditions.
2. **Simulation and Modeling**: Utilize computational fluid dynamics (CFD) tools to simulate the torpedo's behavior.
3. **Performance Optimization**: Propose design improvements to minimize drag.
